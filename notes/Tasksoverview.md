Cloud Top heights and rate of growth vary depending on cloud ice formation processes.
Cloud base heights acts a proxy for temperature and may also influence these processes.
Estimating the heights of cloud tops and bases should help estimate of the controls and
consequences of ice formation.

Height = (Distance to Object x Object height on sensor) / Focal Length

Object height on sensor =  (Sensor height (mm) × Object height (pixels)) / Sensor height (pixels)

Image width x height: 6240 x 4160
Focal Length= 50.mm
Sensor height = 35.9 x 24 mm so 24mm high
